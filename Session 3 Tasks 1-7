#Task 1: How to accept only numbers or characters from the user?
To accept only characters we can use isalpha()

username = input("What is your username)
if username.isalpha() is True:
    print("Hello",username)
else:
    print("Only characters is allowed)

To accept only numbers we can use isnumeric()

password = input("What is your password)
if password.isnumeric() is True:
    print("password is allowed")
else:
    print("Only numbers are allowed")


#Task 2: What is the diffrence between library and framework?

Library targets a specific functionality, while framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.
Also framework can contain lots of libraries


#Task 3: What is OOD With an example?
OOD stands for Object-Oriented Design which is the processof using an object-oriented methodology to design a computing system or application.
OR it is the process of planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a software problem.
OR it is a software design paradigm that is centered around the concept of objects, which represent real-world entities or concepts in a computer program. Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprint templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. Object-oriented design encourages the organization of software into smaller, reusable, and interconnected units, making it easier to manage, maintain, and extend the codebase.
Here is a map for it: https://www.google.com.eg/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.jrank.org%2Fprogramming%2FObjectOriented_Design_OOD.html&psig=AOvVaw1OIbXyjoLhX9-lRPyfOoV-&ust=1698679492866000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCIij6LnIm4IDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD

Examples: create modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems.



#Task 4: How to solve fragmentation:
internal fragmentation: Internal fragmentation occurs when allocated memory or storage is larger than what is actually needed to store the data, which results in unused or wasted space within the allocated block.
solution: 1-Using dynamic memory allocation techniques that allocate memory exactly as needed, which can help minimize internal fragmentation in software development.
          2- Choosing appropriate cluster or block sizes in file systems to minimize unused space within allocated storage units.
          3- Implementing data packing techniques or using data compression to make better use of allocated space.
external fragmentation: external fragmentation occurs when the free space is divided into smaller, non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate larger blocks of memory or storage, even though the total available space might be sufficient.
solution: defragmentation tools can be used to reorganize the data on a storage device. These tools consolidate free space by moving data around, ensuring that files are stored contiguously.



Task 5: What is the diffrence between method and function?
Function: is a set of instructions that perform a task.
Method: a set of instructions that are associated with an object.



Task 6: How to access an element in set{}?
You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key. But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.
OR You can cast the set to a list and then access the element you want and the cast it bacak to set.


Task 7: Do while in python
In Python, you can create a "do-while" loop using a while loop with a conditional statement at the end of the loop. This is similar to the concept of a "do-while" loop found in some other programming languages. The loop will execute at least once, and then it will continue executing as long as the specified condition is true.
example 

count = 0

while True:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1

    if count >= 5:
        break
