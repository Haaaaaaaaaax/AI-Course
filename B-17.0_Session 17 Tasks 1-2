Task 1 : The 3 most famous ML modules that we use until now.
1- RF(Random Forest).
2- SVM(Support Vector Machines).
3- XGBoost


Task 2 : How to transform a non-linear equation to a linear equation?
Basically you can't make a non-linear equation to be a linear equation but there is a substitution trick.
For example if we have an equation like y = ax^2 + b you can just substitute the x^2 to another variable.
