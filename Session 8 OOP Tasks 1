what are the types of inheritance?

1- Single Inheritance:
                      In single inheritance, a class can inherit from only one superclass. That is, a subclass can have only one parent class.
2-Multiple Inheritance:
                       Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one superclass. 
                       This means that a subclass can have multiple parent classes, and it inherits properties and behaviors from all of them.
3-Multilevel Inheritance:
                         In multilevel inheritance, a class can inherit from a superclass, and then another class can inherit from the subclass, creating a chain of inheritance.
4-Hierarchical Inheritance:
                           In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
                           It forms a tree-like structure where one base class has multiple subclasses.
5-Hybrid (or Virtual) Inheritance:
                                  Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance mentioned above.
                                  For example, a class might use multiple inheritance and at the same time, it may participate in other types of inheritance.
6-Single Inheritance with Interfaces (or Pure Abstract Classes):
                                                                Some programming languages, like Java and C#, allow a form of multiple inheritance through interfaces or pure abstract classes.
                                                                An interface defines a contract for classes that implement it, but it doesn't provide any implementation.
                                                                A class can implement multiple interfaces.
