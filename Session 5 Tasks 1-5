Task 1: what is scheduling algorithms and how it works?
Scheduling algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and operating systems.
They are used to manage the allocation of resources, such as CPU time, to various tasks or processes in a multitasking or multiprogramming environment.
The primary goal of scheduling algorithms is to optimize the use of available resources, ensuring that tasks are executed efficiently, fairly, and in a manner that meets specific performance criteria.

and this is how it works:
1-Task Queue: In a multitasking environment, there is typically a queue or list of tasks or processes that need to be executed.
  This queue may contain a mixture of foreground and background tasks, each with its own priority or requirements.

2-Scheduling Criteria: Scheduling algorithms use specific criteria to decide which task to execute next.
  The criteria may include factors such as priority, the amount of CPU time required, the deadline for completion, the amount of memory required, and more.
  Different scheduling algorithms may use different criteria.

3-Dispatcher: The scheduler, which is part of the operating system, is responsible for selecting the next task from the queue based on the scheduling criteria.
  The selected task is then dispatched for execution on the CPU.
  The dispatcher is the component that performs the actual context switch, saving the state of the current task and loading the state of the selected task into the CPU registers.

4-Preemptive vs. Non-preemptive: Scheduling algorithms can be either preemptive or non-preemptive.
  Preemptive scheduling allows a higher-priority task to interrupt the execution of a lower-priority task, whereas non-preemptive scheduling completes the execution of the current task before selecting a new one.

5-Types of Scheduling Algorithms: There are various scheduling algorithms designed to meet different goals. Some common scheduling algorithms include:
  1-First-Come-First-Served (FCFS): The first task in the queue is executed first.
  2-Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF): The task with the smallest execution time is executed next.
  3-Round Robin (RR): Each task is given a fixed time quantum to execute in a cyclic manner.
  4-Priority Scheduling: Tasks are assigned priorities, and the one with the highest priority is executed first.
  5-Multilevel Queue Scheduling: Tasks are grouped into multiple queues, each with a different priority, and tasks are selected from the highest-priority queue.
  6-Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling: Similar to multilevel queue scheduling, but tasks can move between queues based on their behavior.
6-Performance Evaluation: Scheduling algorithms are evaluated based on various performance metrics, such as throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and fairness.
  The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system and the goals of the operating system
