Task 1: What is docker?
docker is a platform which is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments.
containers: Containers are instances of Docker images that run as isolated processes on a host system.
            They provide a consistent and reproducible environment, ensuring that an application behaves the same way regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
images: Docker images are the blueprints for containers.
        They contain the application code, libraries, dependencies, and other necessary components.
        Images are created from a set of instructions defined in a file called a Dockerfile.


Task 2: Compare between stack and heap in RAM.
1- Stack :
          - This memory space stores static variables.
          - When allocated stack memory is full, stack overflow error happens.
          - Data saved on the stack can only be accessed by the owner thread, making it safer.
          - Stack frame access is easier.
2- Heap :
          - This memory space stores dynamic variables.
          - When allocated heap memory is full, stack overflow error happens. 
          - Heap memory is not safest as data stored in Heap-Memory is visible to all threads.
          - Heap frame access is difficult.


Task 3: What is system calls and APIs?
