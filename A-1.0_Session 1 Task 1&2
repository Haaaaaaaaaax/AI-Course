Task 1: What mechanism should we us in python to create an android app?

Best two options for android apps or GUIs is tkinter and kivy both are working on python.
There are some alternatives like QPython whic is a script engine that excutes python on an Android devices, also there are PySide PyMob which are libraries and last we have Pyqtdeploy.
we will only cover tkinter and kivy in this file and know how to import it.




1-tkinter

#Import Module
from tkinter import *
 
# create root window
root = Tk()

# root window title and dimension
root.title("INSTANT")

# Set geometry(widthxheight)
root.geometry('350x200')

#adding a label to the root window
lbl = Label(root, text = "Hello INSTANT Community")
lbl.grid()

# Execute Tkinter
root.mainloop()





2-kivy

#Import Module
import kivy

#Import App to allow us make an android window also label to allow us to write in the app
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import label

#Define the app class
class INSTANT(App):
      def build(self):
          return label(text="Hello INSTANT Community")


#run the app
INSTANT().run()

x: Final = 10
