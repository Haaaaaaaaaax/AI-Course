#Task 1: What is the difference between OOD(Object-Oriented Design) and a class diagram?
1-Object-Oriented Design (OOD):
  Purpose: OOD is a high-level design process that involves defining the structure and behavior of a software system using object-oriented principles. It focuses on how the system will be organized, what classes will be created, and how these classes will interact to fulfill the system's requirements.
  Scope: OOD encompasses the entire design process, including the definition of classes, their attributes and methods, the relationships between classes, and the overall architecture of the system.
  Abstraction: OOD abstracts the real-world entities or concepts into classes and objects, emphasizing the system's architecture and its components.

2-Class Diagram:
  Purpose: A class diagram is a specific type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used to visually represent the structure of a system by illustrating the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. It's a documentation tool for OOD.
  Scope: A class diagram is a part of OOD. It focuses specifically on the classes and their relationships within the system. It provides a static view of the system's architecture, showing the class structure but not dynamic behaviors or interactions.
  Abstraction: Class diagrams are concrete and visual representations of the classes in the system, their attributes, and associations between them.


#Task 2: How to prevent the user from entering a specified character in python?
we can msvcrt library this library works on windows 
other libraries like getch, curses and termios works in unix-like systems and u might want to install it first 
to import it simply user (import msvcrt)


#Task 3: How to read a pdf or word file in python?
1- PDF file
there alot of PDF libraries in python the famous one is PyPDF u can install it using (pip install PyPDF)
there is also ironPDF u can see everything about it in this link : https://ironpdf.com/python/blog/python-pdf-tools/python-read-pdf-tutorial/

2- Word file
you can use a python-docx library you can install it using (pip install python-docx)


#Task 4: How to write a text in a certain line in a text file in python?
to insert anew text in a certain line in a text file we can follow these steps:
                                                                               1- open the file as read as file and read the text file in a variable for example "data" using file.readlines()
                                                                               2- we use insert to the list wich is data in this case using data.insert(index , text)
                                                                                  note that index starts from 0 as 0 = to line 1 & text u have to add \n in the end 
                                                                               3- open the file again as write as file and write the data using file.writelines(data)
for example :
             def insert_text_at_line(file_path, line_number, text):
                 with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                     lines = file.readlines()
                     if 1 <= line_number <= len(lines):
                         lines.insert(line_number - 1, text + '\n')
                         with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
                             file.writelines(lines)
                         print(f'Text inserted at line {line_number} successfully.')
                     else:
                         print(f'Line number {line_number} is out of range.')
