Task 1: what is the difference between system testing, dependence testing, white box testing and unit testing?
1-Unit Testing:
               -Focus: Unit testing is the smallest level of testing and involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation.
               -Scope: It is performed by developers and aims to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
               -Approach: White-box testing is commonly used for unit testing, where the internal structure, logic, and code paths of the individual units are examined.

2-White-Box Testing:
                    -Focus: White-box testing, also known as clear-box or structural testing, focuses on the internal logic and structure of the code.
                    -Scope: It involves testing the internal workings of the software, including code paths, algorithms, and data flow.
                    -Approach: Testers have knowledge of the internal structure of the code, and test cases are designed based on the code's logic. It is commonly used at the unit testing level.

3-Dependency Testing:
                     -Focus: Dependency testing checks how well the software handles external dependencies such as databases, external services, or APIs.
                     -Scope: It assesses the impact of changes in one module or system on other modules or systems.
                     -Approach: It aims to ensure that the software works seamlessly with its external dependencies, and it can be performed at various levels of testing, including integration testing and system testing.

4-System Testing:
                 -Focus: System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole to ensure that all components work together as intended.
                 -Scope: It involves testing the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements.
                 -Approach: It is a black-box testing technique, focusing on the system's external behavior without knowledge of its internal implementation details.
