Task 1: What is vector Database?
A vector database is a type of database that indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search, with capabilities like CRUD operations, metadata filtering, and horizontal scaling.
Usage: 
      1- Long-term memory for LLMs (Large language modules).
      2- semantic search : search based on the meaning or context.
      3- similarity search for text, images, audio, or video data.
      4- recommendation engine.

Task 2: compare between all database types and how to choose the best data base for your project?

1- Hierarchical Databases:
                           -The hierarchical database looks similar to a family tree.
                           -A single object (the “parent”) has one or more objects beneath it (the “child”).
                           -No child can have more than one parent.
                           -In exchange for the rigid and complex navigation of the parent child structure, the hierarchical database offers high performance, as there’s easy access and a quick querying time.
                           -The Windows Registry is one example of this system.

2- Relational Databases:
                         -This database stores data in discrete tables, which can be joined together by fields known as foreign keys.
                         -This database commonly uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.

3-Non-Relational Databases:
                           -Non-relational management systems are commonly referred to as NoSQL databases.
                           -NoSQL databases use a data model that has a different structure than the rows and columns table structure used with RDBMS.
                           -NoSQL databases are different from each other.
                           -There are four kinds of this database: 1- document databases
                                                                   2- key-value stores
                                                                   3- column-oriented databases
                                                                   4- and graph databases.

4- Object oriented databases:
                             -Object oriented databases store and manage objects on a database server's disk.
                             -Object oriented databases are unique because associations between objects can persist.
                             -This means that object oriented programming and the querying of data across complex relationships is fast and powerful.
