Task 1 : What is purposive sampling?
Purposive sampling is a non-random sampling technique,-
where researchers intentionally select individuals or groups from a population based on specific characteristics or criteria,-
relevant to the research question or objectives.


Task 2: What is quota sampling?
Quota sampling is a non-probability sampling technique,
where researchers divide the population into subgroups based on certain characteristics (such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc.),
and then select participants from each subgroup in proportion to their representation in the population. 

Task 3 : What are the types of statistical testing and when to use each type?
1- Paired T-Test:- The paired t-test is used to compare the means of two related groups or conditions.
                   In this test, each subject or observation is measured twice, resulting in pairs of data points.
                 - When to use: You would use the paired t-test when you want to compare the means of two related groups or conditions,
                                such as before and after measurements on the same subjects or repeated measures within the same group.
2- Unpaired(independent) T-test:- The unpaired t-test, also known as the independent samples t-test, is used to compare the means of two independent groups.
                                - When to use: You would use the unpaired t-test when you want to compare the means of two independent groups,
                                               such as two different treatment groups or two groups of subjects that have not been paired together.
3- Chi-square test: - A statistical test used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.
                    - When to use : The chi-square test is appropriate when you have categorical data and want to assess the relationship between two variables.
4- ANOVA(Analysis of variance) test:- A statistical test used to compare means among three or more groups.
                                      It examines whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of the groups by comparing the variance within groups to the variance between groups.
                                    - When to use: ANOVA is appropriate when you have continuous data and want to compare the means of multiple independent groups.
5- MANOVA(Multivariate Analysis of Variance) test:- A statistical technique used to compare the means of two or more continuous dependent variables simultaneously across two or more groups.
                                                  - When to use: MANOVA is used when you have multiple dependent variables and you want to determine if there are significant differences in the means of these variables among different groups or conditions.
                                                    It is particularly useful when you want to avoid inflation of Type I error rates that may occur with conducting separate univariate analyses for each dependent variable.
6- Regression analysis: 1.1- Simple Linear Regression:- A statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a continuous dependent variable.
                                                    - When to use: Simple linear regression is commonly used when you want to understand or predict the impact of one continuous variable on another.
                        1.2- Multiple Linear Regression: - Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.
                                                       -When to use: Multiple linear regression is used when you want to understand or predict the impact of multiple independent variables on a continuous dependent variable.
                        2.1- Simple Logistic Regression:- Simple logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and a single independent variable.
                                                        - When to use: Simple logistic regression is commonly used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, success/failure) and you want to understand or predict the probability of the event based on one predictor variable.
                        2.2- Multiple Logistic Regression:- Multiple logistic regression extends simple logistic regression to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and two or more independent variables.
                                                          - Multiple logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary and you want to understand or predict the probability of the event based on multiple predictor variables.
7- Correlation analysis:- A statistical technique used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.
                        - When to use: Correlation analysis is appropriate when you want to understand the degree to which two variables are related.
